Guidelines for Third Parties Using Ethereum Trademarks
-------------------


These guidelines are for non-Ethereum entities, organizations, developers, projects, individuals, regional meeting organizations, and other parties wishing to use Ethereum’s official trademarks, service marks or images in promotional, advertising, instructional, or reference materials, or on their web sites, products, labels, signage, business cards or packaging.

Ethereum’s trademarks, service marks and trade names are valuable assets. In following these guidelines, you help us protect our valuable trademark rights and strengthen our corporate and brand identities. By using an Ethereum trademark, in whole or in part, you are acknowledging that Ethereum is the sole owner of the trademark and promising that you will not interfere with Ethereum’s rights in the trademark, including challenging Ethereum’s use, registration of, or application to register such trademark, alone or in combination with other words, anywhere in the world, and that you will not harm, misuse, or bring into disrepute any Ethereum trademark. The goodwill derived from using any part of an Ethereum trademark exclusively inures to the benefit of and belongs to Ethereum. Except for the limited right to use as expressly permitted under these Guidelines, no other rights of any kind are granted hereunder, by implication or otherwise. If you have any questions regarding these guidelines, please email us at

## Introduction

Ethereum is a network, organisation, platform, and a global movement. It spreads far beyond the confines of the core development team to every meetup, node, client, developer, user, or third party organization that uses Ethereum implicitly or explicitly.

When you are authorized to use an approved version of the Ethereum logo and its signature in your area of business or expertise, you also represent Ethereum. By following these guidelines, you reap the benefits of the Ethereum identity and contribute to its strength.


### Non-Ethereum Entity Definition

Any developer, startup, project, meetup or other type of organization or individual that is representing or communicating any work or activity that related to Ethereum, but is outside of the governance of the Ethereum Foundation or any legal Ethereum entity  is considered a non-Ethereum entity. We welcome your affiliation with Ethereum, but require you to abide by the branding guidelines set forth by Ethereum, if you wish to use one of the approved Ethereum affiliations. 


#### Ethereum Octahedron Logo Usage

The Ethereum primary Service Mark is the diamond-shape octahedron, as depicted below. It is exclusively used by Ethereum entities. Non-Ethereum entities are prohibited from using the Ethereum logo in any of their communications. If you wish to use the Ethereum logo on promotional material (e.g. T-shirts, mugs, pens, etc.), please contact brand@ethereum.org with the details of your intended usage, and we will consider your request on a case by case basis.

#### Ethereum Ecosystem Signatures

A signature is the combination of the Ethereum logo with a logotype (a name like “Ethereum Based” set in a specially designed type). Ethereum ecosystem signatures communicate your relationship to Ethereum. Always use the correct signature based on the accurate representation of your relationship with Ethereum.


### Types of Approved Ethereum Affiliations 

It’s important to note that neither the word Ethereum nor its logo can be used to claim a partnership with Ethereum when there is none. Ethereum does not have a “partnership” designation for affiliated third parties. There are only 2 types of non-Ethereum entity affiliation choices, and they each carry their respective visual branding requirements as described below.


#### Powered by Ethereum

This affiliation is strictly reserved to Ethereum Dapps, Apps or technologies that are primarily developed on Ethereum, and where Ethereum is an integral, majority or key dependency part of the solution offering or operation, and where there is a dependency on the single core Ethereum global consensus network. You must be approved by Ethereum to be on that list, and you must hyperlink the signature logo to 
a(href='http://www.ethereum.org')www.ethereum.org 
where we will maintain the official list of organizations and projects that are approved to use such logo.

#### Global Ethereum Meetups

The regional Meetup groups that are approved and on the 
a(href='http://forum.ethereum.org/discussion/797/list-of-ethereum-specific-meetups-live-updates')Global Ethereum Meetups list 
may either use the 
a(href='http://forum.ethereum.org/discussion/171/how-to-start-an-ethereum-meetup-faq') generic Meetup assets 
provided by Ethereum, or modify the Ethereum tetrahedron colour scheme to reflect a geographical (i.e. french tricolor) or cultural (i.e. rainbow pride) connection. Note that we will not approve more than one Meetup per city (typically, the first one that is formed is the official one). Example of valid meetup logos include:

### General Guidelines for non-Ethereum Entity Signature Usage

When you follow our guidelines for the permitted uses, you may not:

* alter our logos or signature in any way
* place a logo or image in such close proximity to other content that it is indistinguishable
* make our logo or signature the most distinctive or prominent feature on your website, printed material or other content. This means that your name and logo must appear more prominently than the Ethereum signature * mark on all printed materials related to a publication, web page, seminar or conference.
* use our logo or signature in a way that suggests any type of association, collaboration or partnership with Ethereum or approval, sponsorship or endorsement by Ethereum 
* reference to Ethereum in a way that creates a sense of endorsement or sponsorship by, or other false association with, Ethereum or Ethereum products and technologies.
* use our logo or signature in a way that is harmful, deceptive, obscene or otherwise objectionable to the average person
* use our logo or signature on websites or other places containing content associated with hate speech, pornography, gambling or illegal activities
use our logo or signature to, or in connection with, content that disparages us or sullies our reputation


### Specific Ethereum Referencing
When describing or referencing Ethereum in your documentation, presentation, signage or other publicly visible communications, the following are permitted choices.
Ethereum is a platform to build decentralized applications. 
Ethereum is a decentralized platform that runs smart contracts: applications that run exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud or third party interference.


### Violations of these Guidelines
We will enforce compliance with these guidelines. Anyone found in violation may suffer consequences that may adversely affect the trust that we have placed in them, including the revocation of the privileges of using the Ethereum signatures and the rights to claim an affiliation with Ethereum


### Officially Approved Organizations
Ethereum will maintain an official list of organizations that are allowed to use the Powered by Ethereum signature logo. In the case of any dispute, the official Ethereum list represents the more accurate
