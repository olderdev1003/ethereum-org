## What was the Ether Sale?

In order to raise funds for development of Ethereum to the release of the genesis block and beyond, the Ethereum foundation conducted a sale of Ether to the public, during which anyone could buy Ether in exchange for Bitcoin at a rate of 1337 to 2000 ETH per BTC, with earlier purchasers getting better rates.

The sale lasted 42 days, starting on July 22nd and ending at 23:59 Zug time September 2, and collected a total of 31531 BTC, worth $18,439,086 at the time of the sale, in exchange for about 60102216 ETH.

Without the requirement of payment of ether for every computational step and storage operation within the system, infinite loops or excessive storage demands could bog down Ethereum and effectively destroy it.

### How do I get ether?

There are several ways to get ether. If you just want to test the technology, you might not even need real ether, as you can produce test ether on your own. We've written a complete guide on [all the ways to get ether](../ether).
