## What was the Ether Sale?

In order to raise funds for development of Ethereum to the release of the genesis block and beyond, the Ethereum foundation conducted a sale of Ether to the public, during which anyone could buy Ether in exchange for Bitcoin at a rate of 1337 to 2000 ETH per BTC, with earlier purchasers getting better rates.

The sale lasted 42 days, starting on July 22nd and ending at 23:59 Zug time September 2, and collected a total of 31531 BTC, worth $18,439,086 at the time of the sale, in exchange for about 60102216 ETH.

### What is ether?

Ether is a necessary element -- a fuel -- for operating the distributed application software platform we are building: Ethereum. Without the requirement of payment of ether for every computational step and storage operation within the system, infinite loops or excessive storage demands could bog down Ethereum and effectively destroy it.


### Looking to purchase ether?

We’ve been approached by several Exchanges that are looking to list Ether from the release of the genesis block. We are now actively working with them to ensure Ether will be available to purchase at launch in the form of the Ethereum Exchange Working Group which aims to establish a trading standard for Ethereum, which should improve overall user experience and exchange interoperability. If you are an exchange that wishes to list Ether, please contact info@ethereum.org

A list of exchanges listing Ether will be available on this page at the genesis block launch.
