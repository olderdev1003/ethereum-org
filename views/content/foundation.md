In September 2011 he became the cofounder and original head writer for Bitcoin Magazine. Following this, Vitalik founded Ethereum, a blockchain-based arbitrary-state Turing-complete scripting platform useful for smart contracts, computational resource marketplaces, financial experimentation, decentralized governance and many other use cases that we have not even thought of yet.
