          h2 What is Ethereum?
          p Ethereum is a decentralized platform that runs smart contracts: applications that can be trusted to always run exactly as programmed without any possibility of censorship, fraud or third party meddling. 

          p Ethereum is how the internet was supposed to run. 

          p Ethereum was funded by fans all around the world during a crowdfunding event in August 2014. It continues to be developed by great minds across the globe.

          h2 What is the Frontier Release?

          p Frontier is the first released tool of the Ethereum ecosystem, tailored for developers. It’s a command line only interface with a Javascript environment that allows building, testing, deploying and using decentralized apps and sites on the ethereum blockchain.

          p Exploring the frontier is exciting but it’s also rough, dangerous and not for everyone. Be Warned.
