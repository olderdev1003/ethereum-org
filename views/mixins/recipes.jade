  p Ether is the internal fuel of Ethereum. All programs running on Ethereum need to pay the network for the resources they consume, and in turn <strong>you can volunteer to secure the network to earn this ether ("mining")</strong>.

  p Alternatively, if you participated in the presale to fund the Ethereum development, or won a reward from the Olympic or Bug Bounty programs, you will have a wallet file (.json) that can be imported and give you access to your ether.
  
  p You can also get some from a friend or purchase it online.

    | Kickstart a project with a trustless crowdsale

  p Do you already have many ideas as to what to develop on Ethereum? Maybe you need help and some funds to bring them to life, but who would lend money to someone they don’t trust?

  p Using Ethereum you can create a contract that will hold contributor's money until any date or given goal is reached. Depending on the outcome, the funds are either released to the project owners, or safely returned back to the contributors. All without requiring a centralized arbitrator, a clearing house or having to trust anyone. 

  p You can even use the token you created earlier to keep track of the distribution of rewards.

  p Now that you have developed your idea and secured both backers and funds, what’s next? You now have to hire managers, find a trustworthy CFO to handle the accounts, run Board meetings and do bunch of paperwork. Or you can simply leave all that to an Ethereum contract. It will collect proposals from any of your contributors, then put them up for completely transparent votes.

  p One of the many advantadges of having a robot run your organization, is that it is immune to any outside influence and it’s guaranteed to execute only what it was programmed to. Your organization will never go offline and will always stay available as long as the Ethereum network exists.
